    The key idea: although it is tensor-parallel inference, we only
    create one worker per executor, users will launch multiple
    engines with torchrun-compatible launchers, and all these engines
    work together to process the same prompts. When scheduling is
    deterministic, all the engines will generate the same outputs,
    and they don't need to synchronize the states with each other.
